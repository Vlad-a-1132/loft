<p>Articles 1231 and following of the Civil Code regulate the regime of damages in case of non-performance of the contract, which includes default damages. This is compensation for the debtor&#8217;s delay. Article 1236 provides that: &#8220;Damages due for delay in the payment of an obligation to pay a sum of money shall consist of interest at the legal rate from the date of the notice of default&#8221;.</p>
<p>The applicable legal interest rate is the one defined every six months by order of the French Minister in charge of the economy. According to the order of June 25, 2021 setting the legal interest rate for the second half of 2022, the legal interest rate is set at 0.76% for debts owed by natural persons not acting for professional purposes.</p>
<p>Except with the express, prior and written agreement of the Seller, and provided that the reciprocal claims and debts are certain, liquid and due, no compensation may be validly made between any penalties for late delivery or non-conformity of the Products ordered by the Customer on the one hand, and the sums owed by the latter to the Seller for the purchase of said products on the other.</p>
<p>Any sum paid in advance of the price, deposit or advance payment, shall bear interest at the legal rate at the end of a period of three months from the date of payment until the date of delivery or performance of the service (art. L214-2 of the Consumer Code).</p>
<p>In addition, the Seller reserves the right, in the event of non-compliance with the above payment conditions, to suspend or cancel the delivery of orders in progress made by the Customer.</p>
<p>The Customer shall not be charged any additional costs beyond those incurred by the Seller for the use of a payment method.</p>

<p>The Products ordered by the Customer will be delivered to the address provided by the Customer when placing the order. The Products are accompanied by a delivery note, which must be signed by the Customer or any representative of the latter. The Seller is not responsible for undelivered Products once proof of shipment can be provided.</p>
<p>In the event that delivery is impossible due to an error in the address provided by the Customer, the Seller shall contact the Customer as soon as possible to obtain a new delivery address and any additional delivery charges shall be borne by the Customer.</p>
<p>All postal shipments are assigned a tracking number. Once the order is processed, this number is sent by email with the link to track the package in real time.</p>
<p>The Products purchased by the Customer will be delivered within the time period indicated on the order form. The delivery periods only start to run as from the effective receipt by the Vendor of the sums due.</p>
<p>In the event of a request for modification subsequent to the placing of the order by the Customer, and in particular concerning custom-made Products, the delivery period shall only begin as of the last modification request concerning the custom-made Product.</p>
<p>In the event of a delay exceeding the maximum time limit, the Customer may request the cancellation of the sale and the payments made will then be returned to him by the Seller.</p>
<p>The Seller shall not be liable for any delay or suspension of delivery which is due to the Customer’s default, and inter alia, in the event of late payment, or in case of force majeure.</p>
<p>In the event of a particular request from the Customer concerning the conditions of packaging or transport of the Products ordered, duly accepted in writing by the Seller, the related costs shall be the subject of a specific additional invoice, based on a quotation previously accepted in writing by the Customer.</p>
<p>It is important for the Client to check that the furniture ordered can be delivered to his home. If the Client lives in a specific area or one that is difficult to access (impassable stairwell and/or too narrow a lift, etc.) without it having been specified in advance, the delivery may be overcharged or cancelled. If any doubts, the Client needs to contact Oakâme&#8217;s team to find a suitable delivery solution.<!-- notionvc: d6ea3394-a00c-48fc-b14e-6dd4d13e40b8 --></p>

<p>In accordance with article L. 221-18 of the French Consumer Code, the Customer has a right of withdrawal of 14 days from the date of receipt of the Products to exercise his right of withdrawal from the Vendor, without having to justify his reasons or pay any penalty, provided that the Products are returned in their original packaging and in perfect condition within 14 days of the notification to the Vendor of the Customer&#8217;s decision to withdraw.</p>
<p>The returns are to be made in their original state and complete (packaging, accessories, instructions&#8230;) allowing their return to the market in new condition, accompanied by the purchase invoice.</p>
<p>Damaged, soiled or incomplete products are not accepted.</p>
<p>The right of withdrawal may be exercised by email to the following address: contact@oakame.com and for this purpose, the Customer may use the withdrawal form available in Appendix II of these General Terms and Conditions of Sale, in which case an acknowledgement of receipt on a durable medium shall be immediately communicated to the Customer by the Seller, or any other statement, unambiguous, expressing the will to withdraw.</p>
<p>In the event that the right of withdrawal is exercised within the aforementioned period, only the price of the Product(s) purchased and the delivery costs shall be reimbursed; the cost of returning the Product(s) shall be borne by the Customer.</p>
<p>The refund shall be made, by the same means of payment as the one used for the payment of the order, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties, within 14 days from the notification to the Seller of the withdrawal decision.</p>
<p>However, in accordance with Article L. 221-28 of the French Consumer Code, in the case of distance selling, the right of withdrawal may not be exercised for contracts for the supply of custom-made Products, made to the consumer&#8217;s specifications or clearly personalized.</p>
<p>The right of withdrawal therefore applies only to standard Products.</p>

<p>The Vendor undertakes not to disclose to any other company the personal data collected during the registration of its buyers. The only purpose of the personal data collected is to allow the realization and management of the order and delivery, and also the administrative and commercial management of the customer relationship (e.g. commercial prospecting, commercial operations, settlement of unpaid invoices).</p>
<p>In accordance with the Data Protection Act of January 6, 1978 (amended) and the General Data Protection Regulation, the Customer has a right to access, rectify, portability and deletion of his personal data. The Buyer may also object to the processing of his personal data. If the Buyer wishes to exercise this right, he can write to Tourcoing (59200) 60 Chaussée Albert Einstein or send an email at the following address : <a href="mailto:contact@oakame.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact@oakame.com</a>, indicating his/her name, first name, address, email and, if possible, the buyer&#8217;s reference in order to speed up the processing of his/her request.</p>
<p>The Customer can at any time access and change the information concerning him/her in the customer area under the tab &#8220;my account&#8221;.</p>
<p>The personal data collected from the Customers are subject to computer processing by OAKAME. They are recorded in its buyer file and are essential to the processing of the order.

They will be kept as long as necessary for the execution of orders and any applicable guarantees.</p>
<p>The data controller is the Vendor. Access to personal data will be strictly limited to the employees of the data controller, who are authorized to process them by virtue of their functions.

<p>The Parties shall not be held liable if the non-performance or delay in the performance of any of their obligations, as described herein, results from a case of force majeure, in particular, and not exclusively, in the event of a shortage of raw materials for the Supplier, within the meaning of Article 1218 of the Civil Code.</p>
<p>The Party observing the event shall without delay inform the other Party of its inability to perform its obligations and justify this to the latter. The suspension of obligations shall in no case be a cause of liability for non-performance of the obligation in question, nor shall it give entitlement to the payment of damages or penalties for delay.</p>
<p>The performance of the obligation is suspended for the duration of the force majeure if it is temporary. Consequently, as soon as the cause of the suspension of their mutual obligations disappears, the Parties shall make every effort to resume normal performance of their contractual obligations as soon as possible. To this end, the prevented Party shall notify the other of the resumption of its obligation by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or any extrajudicial act.

<p>In addition, such orders for custom-made Products must be accompanied by a design plan of the Product as requested by the Buyer, specifying its essential characteristics (e.g. raw materials, dimensions).</p>
<p><strong>Sales are perfect and final only after:</strong></p>
<p>  Supplier&#8217;s express written acceptance of the Buyer&#8217;s order, in the form of a quotation proposal, mentioning, inter alia, the price, the dimensions and the raw materials. For custom-made Products, the quotation will be accompanied by a virtual mockup version and acceptance of the quotation implies its acceptance;</p>
<p>  Acceptance of the quotation by the Buyer and full payment at receipt.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the quotation shall be valid for a limited period of thirty (30) days from the date of issue indicated on the said document. After this period, the Buyer must request a new quotation from the Supplier.</p>

<p>The Products are offered within the limits of available stocks. The Supplier shall not be held responsible for the non-performance of the contract in case of stock shortage or unavailability of the Product.  In this case, the Supplier will contact the Buyer in order to propose one of the following alternative solutions: a new delivery date, the replacement of the Product by another equivalent product or the reimbursement of the price of the product in question, without the Buyer being able to claim any compensation.</p>

The photographs and visuals of the Products displayed on the website and catalogs are not contractual and the Supplier shall not be held responsible for any visual variations.</p>
<p><strong>The products are handcrafted and as above-mentioned made from natural materials and may therefore vary by ± 2,5% from the dimensions indicated on the quotation.</strong></p>

<p>Any changes requested by the Buyer shall be taken into account, within the limits of the Supplier&#8217;s possibilities and at its sole discretion, only if they are notified in writing seven (7) days after the order is placed and after the Buyer has signed a specific order form and possibly adjusted the price.</p>

<p>The Supplier undertakes to provide all material and human efforts to deliver the Products as soon as possible. These may vary depending on the geographical area of the Purchaser, the delivery method chosen or the Product ordered.</p>
<p>The delivery times indicated at the time of placing the order do not constitute a strict deadline and the Supplier shall not be held liable in the event of a delay in delivery of less than 60 days.</p>
<p>Moreover, the delivery periods only start to run from the effective collection of the sums due.</p>
<p>In the event of a delay of more than 60 days, the Buyer may only request the cancellation of the sale. The amounts already paid will then be returned to him by the Supplier.</p>
<p>The Supplier shall not be held liable in the event of delay or suspension of delivery attributable to the Purchaser or in the event of force majeure.</p>
<p><strong>5.2. Approval of delivery &#8211; defects of conformity</strong></p>
<p>The Buyer is required to check the apparent condition of the Products upon receive of the Products. If the Buyer detects an <strong>apparent lack of conformity</strong> of the order or the Products upon receipt of the Products:</p>
<p>      The Buyer must express his precise and well-founded reservations at the moment of the reception on the shipping order and ;</p>
<p>      The Buyer has :</p>
<p>  three (3) days for sales made in metropolitan France, in accordance with Article L-133-3 of the Commercial Code, to send a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt to the Supplier;</p>

<p>Concerning the <strong>non-apparent defects of conformity</strong> of the delivered Product, these must be materialized by sending an email with a confirmation of reading to the Seller within three (3) days as from the reception of the Products.</p>
<p><strong>It shall be the Buyer’s responsibility to provide any justification as to the reality of the apparent defects or lack mentioned as reservations</strong>. The Purchaser must allow to the Supplier all facility to proceed with the detection of such defects and shall refrain from repairing the Products without the prior written approval of the Supplier.</p>
<p>The Products cannot be subject to a claim for non-conformity based on the characteristics of the raw materials and in particular by taking into account the disparities of color with respect to the metallic parts of the Products or of the wood or the specificities of the wood such as knots and natural formed cracks.</p>
<p>In case of apparent defect or non-conformity of the Products duly noted by the Supplier in the conditions/conditions provided for above, the Supplier shall replace as soon as possible and at its own expense, the delivered Products whose lack of conformity has been duly proved by the Purchaser. No return of goods shall be accepted without the prior agreement of the Supplier. Any non-conforming Product must be returned in its original packaging, accompanied by a copy of the invoice and any other document that may have been provided.</p>
<p>It is important to check that the furniture ordered can be delivered to the address mentioned by the Client. If the Client’s customer lives in a specific area or one that is difficult to access (impassable stairwell and/or too narrow a lift, etc.) without it having been specified in advance, the delivery may be overcharged or cancelled. If you have any doubts, the Seller needs to be notified in order to find a suitable delivery solution.</p>

<p><strong>7.1. Legal warranty of the Products against hidden defects</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with Article 1641 of the Civil Code, the Products delivered by the Supplier benefit from a legal warranty against hidden defects, as of the date of delivery, resulting from a defect in raw materials, design or manufacture affecting the Products delivered and rendering them unfit for the use for which they are intended.</p>
<p>The warranty forms an inseparable whole with the Product sold by the Supplier.</p>
<p>This warranty is limited to the replacement, repair or reimbursement of non-conforming Products or products affected by a hidden defect.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 1648 paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, in order to assert its rights, the Purchaser shall, under penalty of forfeiture of any action relating thereto, inform the Supplier, in writing, of the existence of the defects within a maximum period of 2 years from their discovery.</p>
<p>The Supplier shall replace or repair the Products or parts that are found to be defective under this warranty. This warranty also covers labor costs and transportation costs but shall not be liable for any costs related to the handling, assembly and disassembly of the Products and any additional costs.</p>
<p>The replacement of defective Products or parts shall not extend the duration of the above warranty.</p>
<p><strong>7.2. Exclusion of guarantee</strong></p>
<p>Any warranty is excluded in case of misuse, negligence or lack of maintenance on the part of the Buyer, as well as in case of abnormal wear of the Product, in case of use in conditions different from those for which the Products were manufactured or in case of force majeure.</p>
<p>It does not apply either in case of deterioration or accident resulting from shock, fall, negligence, lack of supervision or maintenance, or in case of transformation of the Product.</p>
<p>The visual characteristics of the raw materials and ultimately of the Products may evolve and thus the Products may encounter one of the following situations, without the Supplier&#8217;s guarantee being engaged :</p>
<ul>
<li>appearance of mold stains if the Products are left in a closed and non-ventilated place with high humidity;</li>
<li>change in color or appearance of cracks and fissures depending on the climatic conditions to which the Products are subjected (e.g. bad weather, humidity, dryness, exposure to UV rays);</li>
<li>swelling and enlargement of cracks of ± 3% of the Products if they are exposed to water or humidity, dryness or frost ;</li>

<p>In accordance with the Data Protection Act of January 6, 1978 (amended) and the General Data Protection Regulation, the Buyer has a right to access, rectify, portability and deletion of his personal data. The Buyer may also object to the processing of his personal data. If the Buyer wishes to exercise this right, he can write to Tourcoing (59200), 60 Chaussée Albert Einstein or send an email at the following address : <a href="mailto:contact@oakame.com">contact@oakame.com</a>, indicating his/her name, first name, address, email and, if possible, the buyer&#8217;s reference in order to speed up the processing of his/her request.</p>
<p>The personal data collected from the Buyers are subject to computer processing by the Supplier. They are recorded in its buyer file and are essential to the processing of the order. This information and personal data are also kept for security purposes, in order to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.

<p>The Party observing the event shall without delay inform the other Party of its inability to perform its obligations and justify this to the latter. The suspension of obligations shall in no case be a cause of liability for non-performance of the obligation in question, nor shall it give entitlement to the payment of damages or penalties for delay.</p>
<p>The performance of the obligation is suspended for the duration of the force majeure if it is temporary. Consequently, as soon as the cause of the suspension of their mutual obligations disappears, the Parties shall make every effort to resume normal performance of their contractual obligations as soon as possible.
